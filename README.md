# What is it
The single file here is an energy saving patch for Android version of KOReader app, working on Nook Glowlight 4/4e and probably some other models of eInk readers.

# Background
The screen and CPU is the most power hungry parts of a conventional smartphone. Android and other mobile systems take special care to minimize this. One of possible low-consumptions states is Deep Sleep (aka Doze, also I will call it DS here sometimes) mode when the screen is off and CPU basically switches off only to be lightly alert about some of events that might occur. Touching the screen or pressing the hardware buttons are the examples of such events. Most of modern smartphones use this mode, but for them having LCD screens, the mode is possible only when the screen is off.

But eInk devices has a different kind of screen that allows keeping the current image without need for the energy maintaining it. Together with Deep Sleep mode this allows a unique mode of usage when for a short period of time both the screen and CPU is fully working preparing and showing a page and then screen just doesn't consume energy naturally while CPU goes into the Deep Sleep mode. The latter period is obvisouly longer that the former so overall this strategy would theoretically allow saving much energy when reading a e-Book.   

The explained method looks natural and simple, but whether it is implemented and used on a particular device is an open question. The author used to own Nook Simple Touch where this was somehow implemented deep in the system and most of activities somehow naturally used this technique. It felt like the device might work forever on a single charge no matter what the reader app was used. Recently I started using Nook Glowlight 4e and my expectations about this was high. Unfortunately the device didn't meet them. Or rather met them partly. The following observation was made having an excellent app Better Battery Stats as my companion (I will call it BBS). Most of side-loaded apps just worked with the CPU on full-time, no traces of DS whatsoever. But the bundled BN Reader app (bn.ereader) actually used this method according to statictics from BBS. The following investigation allowed me to find the algorithm this app was using
